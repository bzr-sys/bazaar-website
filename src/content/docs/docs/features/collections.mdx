title: Collections
---

Bazaar provides document-orientated (NoSQL) and schema-less databases scoped to a user and app. A database contains collections which are analogous to tables in a relational database. Collections are made up of documents, or docs, analogous to rows in a relational database.

## Using a Collection

To use a collection, create a collection object. By default, a collection object interacts with the database of the authenticated user.

A collection will be lazily created the first time someone tries to interact with it.

```js
const exampleCollection = bzr.collection("example-collection");
// Use the collection
const allDocs = await exampleCollection.getAll();
```

When using TypeScript, you can specify the type of the collection doc.

```ts
type TaskDoc = {
  id: string; // required
  name: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
const tasksCollection = bzr.collection<TaskDoc>("tasks");
```

Collection doc types must include an `id` of type `string`. That is, it must extend or conform to the `Doc` type.

```ts
type Doc = {
  id: string;
};
```

### Use a Specific User's Collection

To use the collection of a specific user, pass an `options` argument to set a user ID. If not explicitly set, the user ID defaults to the authenticated user's.

```js
const options = { userId: "collection-owners-user-id" };
const exampleCollection = bzr.collection("example-collection", options);
```

:::note
[Permission](/docs/features/permissions) is obviously required to access another user's data.
:::

### Handle Lazy Collection Creation

When a collection is lazily created, you might want to take some action. For example, to set [permissions](/docs/features/permissions) or insert some initial data. You can do this as follows:

```js
const options = {
  onCreate: async () => {
    exampleCollection.insertOne({ id: 1, task: "Create first Bazaar app!" });
  },
};
const exampleCollection = bzr.collection("example-collection", options);
```

### Get all Docs

Get all docs from a collection.

```js
const docs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, options);
```

The `filter` and `options` parameters are optional:

```js
const allDocs = await exampleCollection.getAll();
```

A filter allows you to get only a subset of documents. Learn how [Filtering](#filtering) works.

Use the `options` parameter to set offsets and [order](#ordering-sorting) to further control returned docs.

```js
const filter = {}; // No filter
const options = { startOffset: 10, endOffset: 20, orderBy: { height: "desc" } };

const docs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, options);
```

### Get Docs by Page

Offsets are useful, but for a more ergonomic way to work with pagination, there is `getPage`.

```js
const pageNumber = 2;
const pageSize = 20;
const paginatedDocs = await exampleCollection.getPage(pageNumber, pageSize);
```

Like `getAll`, `getPage` also takes optional [`filter`](#filtering) and `options` parameters.

```js
const paginatedDocs = await exampleCollection.getPage(
  pageNumber,
  pageSize,
  filter,
  options,
);
```

The options parameter allows you to [order](#ordering-sorting) the returned docs.

```js
const options = { orderBy: { height: "desc" } };
```

### Get a Doc

Get a single doc.

```js
const doc = await exampleCollection.getOne("example-doc-id");
```

If no document with this ID exists, `null` is returned.

### Insert a Doc

Insert a new doc with an auto-generated ID.

```js
const docId = await exampleCollection.insertOne({ name: "Skylar" });
```

Insert a new doc with a specific ID.

```js
const docId = await exampleCollection.insertOne({ id: "1", name: "Skylar" });
```

The ID must be unique; attempting to insert a document with an existing ID will fail.

### Update a Doc

Update a doc.

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.updateOne(docId, partialDoc);
```

For example, if you have a doc:

```js
const doc = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Leo",
  age: 40,
  weightKg: 80,
};
```

And update as follows:

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.updateOne("1", { weightKg: 82 });
```

The result will be:

```js
const doc = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Leo",
  age: 40,
  weightKg: 82,
};
```

### Replace a Doc

Replace an existing doc with a new one. The new doc completely overwrites the existing doc.

```js
const newDoc = { id: "example-doc-id", name: "New Name", completed: false };
const message = await exampleCollection.replaceOne("example-doc-id", newDoc);
```

### Delete All Docs

Delete all documents in a collection. This action cannot be undone.

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.deleteAll(filter);
```

See [`filter`](#filtering) docs.

### Delete a Doc

Delete a specific document from a collection by its ID.

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.deleteOne("example-doc-id");
```

### Subscribe to Collection Change Events

Receive realtime updates whenever any document in the collection changes. Returns an unsubscribe function.

```js
const unsubscribe = await exampleCollection.subscribeAll(filter, listener);
```

Similar to the `getAll` method, the `filter` is optional and can be empty. See [`filter`](#filtering) docs.

#### Subscribe Listener

The `listener` is an object that contains optional callbacks to be run when a document is added, updated, or deleted. It has the following type:

```ts
type SubscribeListener<T extends Doc> = {
  onAdd?: (doc: T) => void;
  onChange?: (oldDoc: T, newDoc: T) => void;
  onDelete?: (doc: T) => void;
  onInitial?: (doc: T) => void;
};
```

`onInitial` usage notes:

- When a listener is first invoked and an `onInitial` function is provided, it will be called for each existing document in the collection.
- The `onInitial` callback serves as a convenient alternative to manually fetching and iterating over all documents in a collection.
- `onInitial` is particularly useful for initializing local state with existing data from the collection.

For example, instead of:

```typescript
const docs = await bzr.exampleCollection.getAll();
docs.forEach((doc) => addToLocalState(doc));
```

You can use:

```typescript
bzr.exampleCollection.subscribe({
  onInitial: (doc) => addToLocalState(doc),
  // ... other callbacks as needed
});
```

This approach simplifies the process of initially populating local state with existing documents from the collection.

### Subscribe to Doc Change Events

Receive realtime updates for a specific document in the collection.

```js
const docId = "example-doc-id";
const unsubscribe = await exampleCollection.subscribeOne(docId, listener);
```

Returns an unsubscribe function.

See [Subscribe Listener](#subscribe-listener) docs.

### Subscribe Listener Helpers

When subscribing to change events, a common use case is to keep a local array or object in sync with the database. For those cases you can utilize the `arrayMirrorSubscribeListener` and `objectMirrorSubscribeListener` [subscribe listener](#subscribe-listener) helpers to avoid writing boilerplate to update arrays and objects.

```js
const unsubscribe = await exampleCollection.subscribeAll(
  {},
  arrayMirrorSubscribeListener(exampleArray),
);
```

These helpers can also take a [subscribe listener](#subscribe-listener) as a second argument, allowing you to customize any of the listener callbacks.

### Reserved field names and values

All special field names and values that are used throughout Bazaar start with a `$` sign. As such, we recommend not using field names or values that start with a `$`.

In documents, currently the only reserved value is `$now`. It will resolve to a UTC timestamp on the server. This allows you to generate a predictable timestamp in your data no mater in which timestamp the app is running.

## Filtering

You can filter the document queries with fine-grained control.

### Comparison Operatiors

By default, filter values are checked for equality. The filter

```js
const filter = {
  isActive: true,
};
```

will return all documents where `isActive === true`.

Comparison operator can also be specified explicitly. The equality filter above would then look as follows:

```js
const filter = {
  isActive: { $eq: true },
};
```

Filters currently support the following comparison operators:

- `$eq`: equal
- `$ne`: not equal
- `$gt`: greater than
- `$ge`: greater than or equal
- `$lt`: less than
- `$le`: less than or equal

### Filter with `$contains` Operator

The `$contains` operator is used to check if an array field in the documents contains a specified value.

```javascript
// Select documents where the 'tags' array field contains 'urgent'
const filter = {
  tags: { $contains: "urgent" },
};
```

### Filter with `AND` Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `age` is greater than 30 and `isActive` is true
const filter = {
  age: { $gt: 30 },
  isActive: true,
};
```

For simple filters, this is enough. For more complex filtering queries you can also use the `$and` key:

```js
// Select documents where `age` is greater than 30 and `isActive` is true
const filter = {
  $and: [{ age: { $gt: 30 } }, { isActive: true }],
};
```

### Filter with `OR` Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `status` is either 'pending' or 'completed'
const filter = {
  $or: [{ status: "pending" }, { status: "completed" }],
};
```

### Filter with `NOT` Condition

```js
// Select documents where `category` is not 'archived'
const filter = {
  $not: { category: "archived" },
};
```

### Nested Filter Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `manager` is 'John' and either `yearsOfExperience` is greater than 5 or (`department` is 'HR' and `location` is 'New York')
const filter = {
  manager: "John",
  $or: [
    { yearsOfExperience: { $gt: 5 } },
    { $and: [{ department: "HR" }, { location: "New York" }] },
  ],
};
```

And for a more complex example:

```js
/**
 * Select documents where either `height` is between 80 and 140 (exclusive)
 * or `weight` is between 10 and 25 (exclusive), and additionally, `age` is less than 55.
 */
const filter = {
  $or: [
    {
      height: {
        $gt: 80,
        $lt: 140,
      },
    },
    {
      weight: {
        $gt: 10,
        $lt: 25,
      },
    },
  ],
  age: { $lt: 55 },
};
```

## Ordering (Sorting)

The `orderBy` option allows you to sort the results fetched from a collection using the `getAll` or `getPage` methods. By defining the order criteria for one or more fields, you can organize the returned documents according to specific requirements.

`orderBy` is an object where each key represents a field name to sort by, and the value is either `OrderByType.ASC` for ascending order or `OrderByType.DESC` for descending order.

You can sort by single or multiple fields, specifying the order for each field individually:

```js
// Sorting by 'height' in descending order, then by 'age' in ascending order
const orderBy = { height: OrderByType.DESC, age: OrderByType.ASC };
const sortedDocs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, { orderBy });
```

## Managing Collections

Generally, collections are created lazily and don't need additional management. However, in some cases manually creating, dropping, or listing collections is useful.

### Create a Collection

Create collections manually using the `bzr.collections.create` method.

```js
const message = await bzr.collections.create("example-collection-name");
```

:::note
The recommended approach is to have a collection be created lazily by using a [collection object](#using-collections).
A collection object is the most efficient way to interact with a collection's data.
:::

### Drop a Collection

Drop, or delete, a collection and all of its docs.

```js
const message = await bzr.collections.drop("example-collection-name");
```

### List Collections

List the names of all collections.

```js
const collectionsNames = await bzr.collections.list();
```
