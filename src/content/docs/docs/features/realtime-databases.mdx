Bazaar realtime databases are document-orientated (NoSQL) and schema-less.

## Database Architecture

Databases are created per user and per app. Each user gets their own database for your app. And for any other Bazaar-powered app used, a user gets their own separate database.

## Collections

Collections are analogous to tables in a relational databases. Collections are made up of documents, or docs, analogous to rows in a relational databases.

### Create a Collection

Create collections manually using the `bzr.collections.create` method.

```js
const message = await bzr.collections.create("example-collection-name");
```

:::note
The recommended approach is to have a collection be created lazily by using a [collection object](#using-collections).
A collection object is the most efficient way to interact with a collection's data.
:::

### Drop a Collection

Drop, or delete, a collection and all of its docs.

```js
const message = await bzr.collections.drop("example-collection-name");
```

### List Collections

List the names of all collections.

```js
const collectionsNames = await bzr.collections.list();
```

## Using a Collection

The most convenient way to interact with a collection is to create a collection object. By default, a collection object interacts with the database of the authenticated user.

A collection will be lazily created the first time someone tries to interact with it.

```js
const exampleCollection = bzr.collection("example-collection", options);
```

The `options` parameter is optional.

When using TypeScript, you can specify the type of the collection doc.

```ts
type TaskDoc = {
  id: string; // required
  name: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
const tasksCollection = bzr.collection<TaskDoc>("tasks");
```

Collection doc types must include an `id` of type `string`. That is, it must extend or conform to the `Doc` type.

```ts
type Doc = {
  id: string;
};
```

### Use a Specific User's Collection

To use the collection of a specific user, pass an `options` argument to set a user ID. If not explicitly set, the user ID defaults to the authenticated user's.

```js
const options = { userId: "collection-owners-user-id" };
const exampleCollection = bzr.collection("example-collection", options);
```

:::note
[Permission](/docs/features/sharing) is obviously required to access another user's data.
:::

### Handle Lazy Collection Creation

When a database is lazily created, you might want to take some action. For example, to set [permissions](/docs/features/sharing) or insert some initial data. You can do this as follows:

```js
const options = {
  onCreate: async () => {
    exampleCollection.insertOne({ id: 1, task: "Create first Bazaar app!" });
  },
};
const exampleCollection = bzr.collection("example-collection", options);
```

### Get all Docs

Get all docs from a collection.

```js
const docs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, options);
```

The `filter` and `options` parameters are optional.

Learn how [Filtering](#filtering) works.

Use the `options` parameter to set offsets and [order](#ordering-sorting) to further control returned docs.

```js
const filter = {}; // No filter
const options = { startOffset: 10, endOffset: 20, orderBy: { height: "desc" } };

const docs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, options);
```

### Get Docs by Page

Offsets are useful, but for a more ergonimc way to work with pagination, there is `getPage`.

```js
const pageNumber = 2;
const pageSize = 20;
const paginatedDocs = await exampleCollection.getPage(pageNumber, pageSize);
```

Like `getAll`, `getPage` also takes optional [`filter`](#filtering) and `options` parameters.

```js
const paginatedDocs = await exampleCollection.getPage(
  pageNumber,
  pageSize,
  filter,
  options,
);
```

The options parameter allows you to [order](#ordering-sorting) the returned docs.

```js
const options = { orderBy: { height: "desc" } };
```

### Get a Doc

Get a single doc.

```js
const doc = await exampleCollection.getOne("example-doc-id");
```

### Insert a Doc

Insert a new doc with an auto-generated ID.

```js
const docId = await exampleCollection.insertOne({ name: "Skylar" });
```

Insert a new doc with a specific ID.

```js
const docId = await exampleCollection.insertOne({ id: "1", name: "Skylar" });
```

### Update a Doc

Update a doc.

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.updateOne(docId, partialDoc);
```

For example, if you have a doc:

```js
const doc = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Leo",
  age: 40,
  weightKg: 80,
};
```

And update as follows:

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.updateOne("1", { weightKg: 82 });
```

The result will be:

```js
const doc = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Leo",
  age: 40,
  weightKg: 82,
};
```

### Replace a Doc

Replace an existing doc with a new one. The new doc completely overwrites the existing doc.

```js
const newDoc = { id: "example-doc-id", name: "New Name", completed: false };
const message = await exampleCollection.replaceOne("example-doc-id", newDoc);
```

### Delete All Docs

Delete all documents in a collection. This action cannot be undone.

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.deleteAll(filter);
```

See [`filter`](#filtering) docs.

### Delete a Doc

Delete a specific document from a collection by its ID.

```js
const message = await exampleCollection.deleteOne("example-doc-id");
```

### Subscribe to Collection Change Events

Receive realtime updates whenever any document in the collection changes.

```js
const unsubscribe = await exampleCollection.subscribeAll(
  filter,
  ({ oldDoc, newDoc }) => {
    if (!oldDoc && newDoc) {
      // Handle doc added
    }
    if (oldDoc && newDoc) {
      // Handle doc updated
    }
    if (oldDoc && !newDoc) {
      // Handle doc deleted
    }
  },
);
```

See [`filter`](#filtering) docs.

A `filter` is optional.

```js
const unsubscribe = await exampleCollection.subscribeAll({}, listener);
```

Returns an unsubscribe function.

### Subscribe to Doc Change Events

Receive realtime updates for a specific document in the collection.

```js
const docId = "example-doc-id";
const unsubscribe = await exampleCollection.subscribeOne(
  docId,
  ({ oldDoc, newDoc }) => {
    if (!oldDoc && newDoc) {
      // Handle doc added
    }
    if (oldDoc && newDoc) {
      // Handle doc updated
    }
    if (oldDoc && !newDoc) {
      // Handle doc deleted
    }
  },
);
```

Returns an unsubscribe function.

## Handle a Successful Connection Event

Execute a callback function when a successful connection to the database is established.

```js
bzr.onApiConnect(() => {
  console.log("Connected to the database successfully.");
});
```

## Handle a Connection Error Event

Execute a callback function when there is an error connecting to the database.

```js
bzr.onApiConnectError((error) => {
  console.error("Connection error:", error);
});
```

## Filtering

You can filter the document queries with fine-grained control.

### Filter with `AND` Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `age` is greater than 30 and `isActive` is true
const filter = {
  age: { $gt: 30 },
  isActive: true,
};
```

### Filter with `OR` Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `status` is either 'pending' or 'completed'
const filter = {
  $or: [{ status: "pending" }, { status: "completed" }],
};
```

### Filter with Combined AND and OR Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `age` is less than 50 and either `status` is 'active' or `score` is greater than 80
const filter = {
  age: { $lt: 50 },
  $or: [{ status: "active" }, { score: { $gt: 80 } }],
};
```

### Filter with `$contains` Condition

The `$contains` operator is used to check if an array field in the documents contains a specified value.

```javascript
// Select documents where the 'tags' array field contains 'urgent'
const filter = {
  tags: { $contains: "urgent" },
};
```

### Filter with `NOT` Condition

```js
// Select documents where `category` is not 'archived'
const filter = {
  $not: { category: "archived" },
};
```

### Nested Filter Conditions

```js
// Select documents where `manager` is 'John' and either `yearsOfExperience` is greater than 5 or (`department` is 'HR' and `location` is 'New York')
const filter = {
  manager: "John",
  $or: [
    { yearsOfExperience: { $gt: 5 } },
    { $and: [{ department: "HR" }, { location: "New York" }] },
  ],
};
```

And for a more complex example:

```js
/**
 * Select documents where either `height` is between 80 and 140 (exclusive)
 * or `weight` is between 10 and 25 (exclusive), and additionally, `age` is less than 55.
 */
const filter = {
  $or: [
    {
      height: {
        $gt: 80,
        $lt: 140,
      },
    },
    {
      weight: {
        $gt: 10,
        $lt: 25,
      },
    },
  ],
  age: { $lt: 55 },
};
```

Filters are powerful and can get complex. To understand the full capabilities of filters, see these corresponding types:

```ts
/**
 * A FilterObject is an object that either maps
 * - string keys to string | number | boolean | null. This corresponds to an equality operation
 * - string keys to FilterComparison. This corresponds to the operation defined in FilterComparison
 * - $and to FilterObject[]. This combines the result of each FilterObject in the array with AND
 * - $or to FilterObject[]. This combines the result of each FilterObject in the array with OR
 * - $not to FilterObject. This applies NOT to the result of the FilterObject
 *
 * All fields in a FilterObject are combined with an AND.
 */
export type FilterObject = {
  $and?: FilterObject[];
  $or?: FilterObject[];
  $not?: FilterObject;
  [field: string]: FilterComparison | string | number | boolean | null;
};

/**
 * A FilterComparison is an object, that applies a set of comparison operators.
 * Multiple properties are combined with AND. Most comparison operators are self-explanatory
 * logical operators except for contains, which checks if an element is part of an array.
 */
export type FilterComparison = {
  $eq?: string | number;
  $ne?: string | number;
  $gt?: string | number;
  $ge?: string | number;
  $lt?: string | number;
  $le?: string | number;
  $contains?: string | number;
};
```

## Ordering (Sorting)

The `orderBy` option allows you to sort the results fetched from a collection using the `getAll` or `getPage` methods. By defining the order criteria for one or more fields, you can organize the returned documents according to specific requirements.

`orderBy` is an object where each key represents a field name to sort by, and the value is either `"asc"` for ascending order or `"desc"` for descending order.

You can sort by single or multiple fields, specifying the order for each field individually:

```javascript
// Sorting by 'height' in descending order, then by 'age' in ascending order
const orderBy = { height: "desc", age: "asc" };
const sortedDocs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, { orderBy });
```

When using TypeScript, `orderBy` leverages the `OrderByType` enum for type safety:

```typescript
import { OrderByType } from "@bzr/bazaar";

const orderBy: OrderBy = { height: OrderByType.DESC, age: OrderByType.ASC };
const sortedDocs = await exampleCollection.getAll(filter, { orderBy });
```
