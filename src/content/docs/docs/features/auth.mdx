title: Auth
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

RethinkID provides authentication out-of-the-box allowing you to create and authenticate users securely and easily.

Authorization is provided with the [Sharing API](/docs/features/sharing).

## Sign up and Log in

Sign up and log in are conveniently combined into a single method call:

```js
rid.login();
```

Calling the `login` method opens a pop-up window by default, which falls back to redirect login if the pop-up fails to open.

Login types `popup_fallback`, `popup`, and `redirect` can be optionally set:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JS">
    ```js
    rid.login({ type: "redirect" });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="TS">
    ```ts
    import { LoginType } from "@rethinkid/rethinkid-js-sdk";

    rid.login({ type: LoginType.REDIRECT});
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Log Out

A utility method to delete an auth token from local storage and perform a page refresh.

```js
rid.logOut();
```

## Check if a User is Logged In

A utility method to check if an auth token is set in local storage.

```js
rid.isLoggedIn();
```

## Handle a Successful Login Event

Logging in takes place without a page fresh, so you need a way to handle a successful login event. To do so, set a callback as the first and only argument of `onLogin`:

```js
rid.onLogin(() => {
  // Handle user log in
  // e.g. Set local state and redirect
});
```

## Handle a Failed Login Event

Handle a failed login event:

```js
rid.onLoginError(() => {
  // Handle log in error
  // e.g. Show error message
});
```
