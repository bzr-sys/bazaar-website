Bazaar introduces the simplest way to monetize your app and allow your users to monetize their content.

## How It Works

The subscription API is simple. The app developer or users may create plans which other users can subscribe to. Bazaar's permission API then allows users to give access to data based on whether a user has subscribed to a certain plan.

## Benefits for Developers

- **Simple Setup:** The Subscription API is simple to use. There is no need for backend configuration or webhook setup.
- **Paid App Features:** Easily set up app features that require a subscription. Multiple tiers and plans are possible.
- **Earn with your users:** Get a cut from all subscriptions in your app, including for plans created by your users.

## Benefits for Users

- **Overview Over Costs:** See & manage all subscriptions from all Bazaar apps you are using in one place.
- **Earnings Dashboard:** Get an overview of all plans you offer in all your Bazaar apps. See all your earnings across all plans you offer.
- **Simple Control** End subscriptions anytime, without hoops or endless "are you sure you don't want to stay for a discount" screens.
