Bazaar introduces the simplest way to monetize your app and allow your users to monetize their content.

### How It Works

The monetization API is simple. The app developer or users may create products which other users can purchase or subscribe to. Bazaar's permission API then allows users to give access to data based on whether a user has purchased or subscribed to a certain product.

### Benefits for Developers

- **Simple Setup:** The Monetization API is simple to use. There is no need for backend configuration or webhook setup.
- **Paid App Features:** Easily set up app features that require a monetization. Multiple tiers and plans are possible.
- **Earn with your users:** Get a cut from all payments in your app, including for products created by your users.

### Benefits for Users

- **Overview Over Costs:** See & manage all payments from all Bazaar apps you are using in one place.
- **Earnings Dashboard:** Get an overview of all products you offer in all your Bazaar apps. See all your earnings across all products you offer.
- **Simple Control** End subscriptions anytime, without hoops or endless "are you sure you don't want to stay for a discount" screens.
