title: Privacy and Data Protection
summary: Bazaar protects user privacy by separating user data from the actual app. This gives users total visibility and control over the data that was provided to any Bazaar app. This also helps app developers with regulatory requirements such as GDPR.

Bazaar is basically an identity provider on steroids. In addition to your identity, it also provides data storage that can be used within the context of an app. This means, a user's data is stored in their Bazaar account instead of an app's backend.

## The right Incentives

When using a free or paid app such as Google maps, Instagram, or Amazon Prime, it is never entirely clear what role the value of our data plays in our interactions with the app. For a Bazaar app the incentive is always to provide you a service, as it can never be to get your data, simply because your data is not stored with the application.

## Benefits for Users

- **Privacy:** With any app you use, you have to hope the owner takes your privacy seriously. However, when using a Bazaar app, you do not have to trust the application itself. Your data's privacy is taken care of by Bazaar.
- **Control Over Data:** Your Bazaar account lets you see and manage all data that is used by your apps. You can easily delete all data for any app without interacting with the app or their owner.
- **Data Ownership** We believe your data should belong to you and with all Bazaar apps this is the case. You can download the data and do with it what you see fit.

## Benefits for Developers

- **No Policy Worries:** Create the app you want to create without worrying about privacy compliance. Ensuring compliance with GDPR and other policies can be complicated and intimidating. With Bazaar all backend data is under the user's control which makes your app automatically compliant.
- **Transparency & Trust:** Creating a Bazaar app signals transparency. A user knows you will not take advantage of their data which fosters trust.
- **Portability:** The decoupling of apps from their data, allows you to easily import data from other apps to offer a related or better service (coming soon).
