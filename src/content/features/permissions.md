Bazaar comes with a powerful permissions API, empowering developers to implement sharing and collaboration in their applications.

With the database-per-user architecture, users can interact with their data by default. The Permissions API facilitates granting access to other users. Permissions can be granted to docs and collections with filters to deliver precise control.
