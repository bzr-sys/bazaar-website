RethinkID includes a powerful Sharing API, empowering developers to implement sharing and collaboration in their applications. With the database-per-user architecture, users can interact with their data by default. The Sharing API is used to grant access to others. This feature offers granular control over database collections and documents, enabling precise access rights management down to individual document levels.

The Sharing API is simple to use but caters to complex sharing scenarios. This control extends to creating shareable links and subscribing to change events, allowing developers to track when a link is created, updated, deleted, or redeemed in realtime. Developers can subscribe to changes in permissions granted to an user.

## TODO

- Show diagram with permission granted to another user
- Show code snippet for permission, maybe
