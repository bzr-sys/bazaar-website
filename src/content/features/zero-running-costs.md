RethinkID introduces a groundbreaking approach to app development empowering developers to create without running costs. This unique offering enables developers to pursue their creative ideas, from personal hobby projects to large-scale applications, without worrying about escalating expenses.

## How It Works

The key to RethinkID's innovative model lies in its user-centric approach. When users first sign up for a RethinkID-powered app, they create a RethinkID account. Their free RethinkID plan includes generous bandwidth and data storage so users can explore any RethinkID-powered app. Users' usage is based on their bandwidth and data storage consumption rather than the amount of apps they use. When a user wants more resources, they can upgrade to a flexible paid plan.

## Benefits for Developers

- **Focus on Innovation:** With running costs off the table, developers can concentrate on what they do best â€“ creating remarkable apps.
- **Seamless Scalability:** If an app gains popularity, it can scale effortlessly. The cost of scaling is borne by the users who find value in the app, making the model sustainable and fair.
- **Sustainable Hobby Projects:** Developers can build and maintain their hobby projects indefinitely, without the pressure of running costs.

## Benefits for Users

- **Control Over Costs:** Users only pay for what they use, ensuring they invest in apps that provide the most value.
- **Transparency in Usage:** The precise structure of free and paid plans offers transparency, allowing users to manage their app usage and costs effectively.
- **Data Ownership** The RethinkID database-per-user-per-app architecture gives users ownership and control over their data. Users can view, export, and delete any app-associated data from their RethinkID Dashboard. They can even revoke app authorization while retaining their data.
