Clouded revolutionizes the development process with its lightning-fast TTFA (Time To First App), enabling developers to launch applications swiftly and efficiently. The [database-per-user-per-app architecture](../features/realtime-databases) eliminates the need for complex access policies, as users can automatically access their databases. This streamlined approach is further enhanced by optional lazy collection creation and a schema-less, document-oriented database design for maximum flexibility.

Additionally, the SDK simplifies [authentication](../features/authentication) by automatically storing access tokens in local storage and seamlessly authenticating them with data API connection connections. This authentication process removes the hassle of manual token management and ensures secure, effortless communication in your applications.

With Clouded, you can focus on building great features rather than getting bogged down in setup and configuration.
