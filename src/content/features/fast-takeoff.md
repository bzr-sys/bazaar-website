RethinkID helps achieve a fast TTFA (Time To First App), enabling developers to launch applications swiftly and efficiently.

## Low Friction Data Access

The [database-per-user-per-app architecture](../features/realtime-databases) eliminates the need for complex access policies, as users can automatically access their databases. Development friction is further reduced by lazy collection creation and a schema-less, document-oriented database design for maximum flexibility.

## Streamlined Authentication

The RethinkID SDK simplifies the [authentication](../features/authentication) process, managing login requests, auth code exchanges for access tokens, token storage, and integration with users' [realtime database](/features/realtime-databases), creating a cohesive and secure user experience.
