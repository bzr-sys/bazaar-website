  <p>There are numerous reasons to use Bazaar, depending on the lense you are looking through.</p>

  <!-- Dev -->
  <h1>Why developers should use Bazaar</h1>

  <h2>Simplicity</h2>
  <p>
    With Bazaar, every front-end developer can build full-stack applications. There is literally no simpler way to build an SPA, PWA, or any other app that usually requires a backend. Granted, this simplicity has a cost, i.e., you cannot create an arbitrary complex app without a custom backend. However, for 90% of your ideas it will certainly be enough. We easily created a <a href="/apps/chat">messaging app</a>, a microblogging platform, a multiplayer game, a kanban board, and so on. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, more comlex than building an app is actually deploying it. With Bazaar, deployment is trivial. Your app is just a static site and you can host it whereever you like: GitHub pages, Netlify, your own nginx setup, or anywhere else.
  </p>

  <h2>Data privacy and security</h2>
  <p>
    Dealing with user data is complicated, especially when myltiple juristictions come into play. Are you following all GDPR rules when you ask your users for their email address? With Bazaar, you don't have to worry about data regulation compliance. All data is handled in Bazaar, so we do that work for you.</p>
  <p>
    In addition to compliance there is security of user data. Following best practices to make sure data cannot be stolen or lost is hard. Again, with Bazaar you can focus on building your app and we take care of safekeeping your users' data.
  </p>

  <h2>No running costs</h2>
  <p>
    The early open source days started with the joy of sharing ones useful creations. Now, in the age of web apps, sharing a useful tool has become much harder. When an app you deploy for yourself and your friends to use becomes popular, you suddenly run into hosting costs you are unwilling or unable to cover. So you either have to come up with a business model or shut down the app. With Bazaar, you no longer have to worry about costs. The backend is free for developers, users pay the data they use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bazaar allows you to focus on your ideas, focus on the functionality you want to provide, focus on making your app better, and scale up without worrying about costs.
  </p>

  <h2>Built-in social features</h2>
  <p>
    Handling user information, their contacts, and connections is all built into Bazaar and available via a  <a href="/docs/features/social/">simple API</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take advantage of social interactions from other Bazaar apps. Since social features are integrated into Bazaar, all apps get the same view of a user's contacts. For example, if somebody added their partner as a contact to share a shopping list in one app, the contact is also available to this user in your messaging app.
  </p>

  <h2>Trivial to monetize (coming soon)</h2>
  <p>
    Bazaar comes with a simple subscription API that allows you to create powerful apps. You or your app's users can create plans other users can then subscribe to. This allows you to not only monetize users directly but also enable features where users create paywalled content, similar to platforms like Substack or Patreon.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast to other platform for creators where the platform takes a revenue cut (e.g., 30%), for Bazaar apps there are three parties: the platform, the developer, and the creator. The creator should still get the largest cut, however, the developer should also be rewarded for their creation and get part of the revenue.
  </p>


  <!-- User -->
  <h1>Why users should use Bazaar</h1>

  <h2>Is there an app you like?</h2>
  <p>
    To be frank, it is very simple. You will only use Bazaar if there is a Bazaar app you want to use. Check out <a href="/apps">available apps</a> to see if anything catches your eye. If not, <a href="mailto:hello@bzr.dev">let us know</a> what app you would want us to build.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, for any Bazaar app there might be a similar traditional app out there that offers similar features. In that case, there is clear benefits to choosing the Bazaar app. Read on to learn what they are.
  </p>


  <h2>Data ownership</h2>
  <p>
    Most apps out there, especially free apps, collect and harvest your data. This is not the case for Bazaar apps. A Bazaar app uses the data in your Bazaar account. As such, the creator of any given Bazaar app does not have access to your data. Only you do via your Bazaar account. This way, your privacy is guaranteed no matter what Bazaar app you use.
  </p>
  <p>
    All data from all your Bazaar apps is stored in your Bazaar account. This data is yours and you control this data. You can delete or download it with a click of a button. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future we want to even go one step further and implement a seamless way for you to transfer data to a new app. So if you are using a shopping list app that hasn't been updated in a while and you want to change to a newer, compatible shopping list app, just take our data and switch. It is your data after all.
  </p>

  <h2>The right incentives</h2>
  <p>
    You might have heard the saying "if you are not paying for a service, you are the product". Running an app incurrs costs and if a user does not have to pay to cover these costs, the app owner obviously has another revenue stream, most likely one that involves selling or using your data. For Bazaar, the incentives are clear. We want to build the easiest platform for developers to create great apps. When users like you use these apps, we charge you to host and manage your data. Thats it. No hidden agenda.
  </p>


  <!-- Business -->
  <h1>Why businesses should use Bazaar</h1>

  <p>
    Businesses are also users, so similar reasoning applies. There are however, a few extra benefits that applies specifically to organizations.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Data privacy and security</h2>
  <p>
    With each application you introduce in your organization, you need to make sure their data and privacy policy is actually acceptable. On top of this, you always run the risk of some data leakage if an app developer does not take data security as seriously as they should. With Bazaar, data for all apps is safeguarded in your Bazaar account. As such your data privacy and security is handled by Bazaar.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use best practices to protect your data from loss or theft. We understand that larger organizations require certain data compliance certifications. We work together with all our enterprise customers to make sure all their compliance needs are met.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Bazaar, private users are in control of their data. In organizational accounts, data control and retention policies for their and their users' data are set by the organization. This protects organizations from rogue employees or accidental deletions.
  </p>

  <h2>An ever expaning app catalogue</h2>
  <p>
    One benefit of Bazaar is that the app catalogue keeps expaning. You can use new or better apps in your organization with the same business relationship you have with Bazaar. Also, as mentioned previously, all the same privacy and data policiy apply for all new apps you use.
  </p>

  <h2>Easily customize open-source apps</h2>
  <p>
    The open-source ecosystem is incredible. Not only can you find an app to solve any problem, you can also modify the code and tailor all apps to your needs. However, deploying or hosting such tailored apps can be very complex and costly. With Bazaar, apps are just static sites so deployment is trival. As such it is very easy to tailor open-source Bazaar apps to your needs and deploy them.
  </p>

  <!-- Edu -->
  <h1>Why educational institutions should use Bazaar</h1>

  <p>
    All business benefits obviously also apply to educational institutions. There are, however, some unique advantages to using Bazaar in an educational setting.
  </p>

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <p>
    Students often encounter problems that are unique to their setting or have ideas to improve thier or their fellow students lifes. Bazaar is the simlest platform to build a web based app that solves a problem for you or other people. With its integrated social features it can easily build an app that is meaningful for fellow students and with the monetization feature (coming soon) students can even foster their entrepreneurial spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help with fostering these useful skills, creating Bazaar apps can be easily integrated into a course, workshop, bootcamp, or competiton. Especially for less technical students, as the programing knowledge is more basic (front-end web development only).
